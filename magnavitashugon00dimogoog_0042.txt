with us, h'as scarcely beon known, except, in a way,
in his own cathedral city. Theman who built the
glorious church of Lincoln,¹ could not in Lincoln be
altogether forgotten Elsewhere, few indeed could be
found who have a uotion about him, though his name
still stands in our English calendar. lt may be that
our dislike of the undue worship once paid him has
been partly the cause of this forgetfulness of a great
and good man; but the main cause ol ithus lain in
the Christian excellencies of his character. He ever

(infra, p. 82), speaks of him as on the other hand, Hugh had fixed

Lincoln (⁴⁶ nobilis fabrica, quam which wason the north side of the

p. 336, l. 32). That the choir,
however, was fimshed, we may con·
clude, Ι think, safely. The concur·

built the church can well mean no
less. And perhaps it was but just
finished, for, ou his death-hed, Hugh

were no part of the new building
yet ready for service. And itis
worth remark that Iloveden de·
scribes John as offering a chalice ol
gold atthis same altar of St. John
Baptist the day before Hugh’s body
arrived at Lincoln for burial (·‘ in·

and it does not follow, &cause he
directs it to be got ready for the
purpose, that the internal littings of
the other parts oi the choir were
still incomplete, and it is easy to
understand why John, at such a
time, should choose to contribute bis
offering to this particular altar.

But however much Hugh may
himself have actually built, the
whole church in away belongs to
him. The completion ol it by his
immediate successore was but the
carrying out ol his designa 3 aud the

who flocked to do honour to the
now famous canonized saint.
