There is abundant proof that he was much valued hy
Hugh, and admitted to the ulosest relations of intimacy.¹
He was the favoured companion of his privaoy, the
recipient of all his thoughts and wishes, the depositary
of the sacred secreta of the confessional

As to what became of him for several years after
Hugh's death, he gives us no intimation. He would
probably return to bis convent, wherever that was.

³⁰¹³* arouse, aa hospitable altercassent for
nearly three months of this period at Paris, by Rei·
mund, a relation of Hugh, canon of Lincoln, and
archdaaoon of Iseiceater.² And elsewhere speaks of a
visit to the Cistereian abbey of Olermarotz near St.
Omer's.³ It appears that he was engaged at this time
in writing this Life of St. Hugh.⁴ He seems to have
retained to England by 1212 3⁶ and he twice uses
expressions which show that in or about this year he
was also employed upon the Life.6 We may be sure
that the Life was completed and published before 1220,
the year of Hugh's eanonization; an event which, had
it taken place before he had fully completed the work,
our author most certainly would not bave passed over,
as he does, in entire silence.

The above notices of himself, circa Ab. 1212, are

the latest that are to be found in our author’s peges.
Somewhat‚ however, of his after history may be
glcaned from other quarters.
