Pausauu xv

Chroniele, whioh was printed by Theodora Petreius
at Cologne in 1608. The third hook of this Chro-
niele is wholly devoted to St. Hugh. This is mainly
taken from the Magna Vita, hut with considerable
additions from the Legenda3 and ends with an account
of the translation of Hugh’s body in 1280, from some
later souree.

The portion from the Magna Vita is an⁰abridgmout
proper, rather than an abbreviation3 aud not always
a very faithful one. It would seem as if Dorlaudus
sometimes wrote without his authority exaotly before
his eyes3 aud as if, in his admiration of the great Car-
thusian saint, for such had Hugh long been considered,¹
a zealous memory led him to say more, οι· to put things
in a strouger light, than he was quite justified in doing.
Oeoesionally, however, he quotes nearly the exuet words
of the Magna Vita3 and in sueh instaures giues sorne-
times some help in ease of doubtful readings.
