oommenoed long after that event, hia information
would depend, not upon the recollection of what he
had himself seen and known, buton the recollection
of what he had heard from others. Let any ono look
back upon what he had been told a dozen years before
of the events in any ever so deor a friend's life, and

think hovv very easily he might be wrong a year in
the dato of some event if he had nothing but his
memory to trust to, though he vves perfeetly clear
and certain about the events themselves.

In Lib. 1V.,cap. 12, our author gives an interesting
recount of a lay-brother of the Great Chartreuse,
σθω, de Nm whom he calls Girard, “oonsul Niversi·

Μ “ ensium,” 16, comte du Nivernais.¹ A
part at least of what he says of this Girard seems
clearly to belong to the famous william, comte do
N evers (N immensis), vvho entered the Great Obartreuse
1111147, and died in 1148; but instead 01 this, ho
describes him as having lived for a long time after his
admission² Elsewhere, apparently speaking of the
samo person, he calls him Girard, “eomes Nivernen·
⁴‘ sium,’' and seems to describe him as a brother 01
110 Great Chartreuso in Hugh's early days there, ia,
after 11110.8 Probably our author has confounded tho
histories of two distinet persons whom he had heard
talked of by Hugh, viz„ William, eomte de Nevers, and
a Girard, comte du Nivernais, or with some similarly-
sounding title ; a very likely blunder to be made, even
by a very accurate men, with a very aoourate memory.
A Gimrd, a lay-brother, and of gentle blood,⁴ one
powerful too in discourse vvith magnates 11111111111060,δὲ
as he amply shovved in his fieree objurgation of Henry ΙΙ.
