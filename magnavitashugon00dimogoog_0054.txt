and actions, but would tell openly his more secret
experiences, bis sinli11 thoughts and inclinatione even,
his struggles with the temptor. At any rate, all such
secret matters were made no secret of by him with
persons who enjoyed such close intimacy with him
as did our author.

It was this close intimacy with Hugh that more
especially induced the monks of Witham to press our
author to write this Life. Other Lives were already
written, but by persons who had not enjoyed the like
familiarity with Hugh. So far as we know, these have
perished, with the exception os that by Giraldus Cam·
bremis, superseded, no doubt, by the greater value of
the present Life. This wc now regnet, for they would
have added much to our knowledge os Hugh's history.
Our author, because of these previous Lives, professes,
more than once, not to attempt a complete biography
of Hugh, but rather to relate especially what his
intimacy with Hugh enabled him to relate more truth-
fully and fully than could have been in the power
of others.¹ He omits much, he says, most worthy of
record, because it had been already sufficiently well
told by others. But while we regret the loss of these
earlier accounts, we may congratulata ourselves that
their once existence has been the cause of a greater
velue in what our author has left us. They led to
a large portion os tha present Life, more especially

the part which embraces the period before bis entrance
into Hugh's family, being, in great measure, a record
of Hugh's intimate talks with him, or in his presence.
We may look upon much os what this volume contains,
it seems strongly to me, almost aa if it had been
penned by Hugh's own hand.
