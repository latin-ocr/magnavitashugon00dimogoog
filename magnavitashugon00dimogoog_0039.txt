niclers all agree in scying that Hugh was consecrated
on st. Matthew's day, no one of them ever says thot
this was a Sundsy. The chronicle 01 Benedictns Abbes
was unknown 10 the editor: it was not printed until
two ycnrs after the volume of Penius hed appeared.
This says expressly that the consecration took place
‘⁴ 00 the feast 01 St. Matthew apostle, 0 Sanday, the
“ llth before the kalende of October.'’¹

It was therefore 00 September 21, 1186, most cer·

Ηο lest Lcndon st once for the place of his new duties‚
and was enthroned in Lincoln cathedml on Mondny‚
September 29? I must not attempt to trace his career
as bishop of Iincoln: 10 do it, however briefly, would
extend this preface beyond all reasonable limite It
must suffice 10 say—what not only this Life, but every
contemporary mention of his doings as 0 bishop helpe

10 God's service, 011 the Canthusicn contempt for the
things 01 this world. Nowhere, perhaps, but in a Oar-
tbusisn 0011, could such a men as Hugh of Lineoln
have been formed He seems to stand alone amongst
the bishops 01 his day, 011 01 whom, more or less, were
creaturas of the court3 good and holy men, 11 may be,
