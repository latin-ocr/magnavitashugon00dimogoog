“ mam, transiremus,” p. 274.
Our author also, in common

with the abbot of Eynslram,

speaks os the madman as a

“nauta'' p. 276, 1. 30.

The similarity of details and of expressions in these
two accounts os the madman, and of the mode of cure,
point strongly to their having come from one person.
The same points are brought prominently forward in
both3 and there are just the agreemenls and differeuces
in the way iu which the tale is told, that we should
expect in two versione by the same person, with some
interval of time between them, but with his memory
still vivid on what struck him as the more remarkable
circumstances The subsequent visit to Oheshunt with
the abbot cs Waltham, and anquiries about the mad-
mau’s after sate, found iu both accounts, seem to me
to render the identity of the authors all but certain,
bearing in mind that there was the same name Adam,

and the same office os chaplain to Hugh. It is indeed

possible that Hugh had two chaplains named Adam;
that these were both present ou this occasion at
Cheshunt ; that each of them afterwards visited Cheshunt

in company with the abbot of Waltham, and made
anquiries about the madman; and that the similarity
of their versione was owing to some such reccident as
the one having relrcshed his memory from the history
of the other, before giving his evidence to the com-
missioners, or their having often talkcd the matter over
together, and so got the same prominent points fixed
on their memorias, aud the similar modes of expression
ready at their tongues' ends. But such a combination
of coincidences is extremely improbable, and would
require good evidence before we could receive it. In
the entire absence of any such evidence, Ι shall ven-

turc to consider it as a fact, that our author became
abbot of Eynsham in 1213.
