The editor of the abbreviated Life in Penius, in his

prefatory Mortifera, expresses himself perfeotly satis-
fied that the author of this Magna Vita was a monk

of St Augustine's of Canterbury. His only reason for
which fancy, for a mere fancy it is, seems to have
been that our author happens to mention having twice
held a conversation with a monk of that house² He
was avare, from Molnnus's note to Usuurdus, that our
author’s name began with A, buthe did not know of
the good evidence there is that the name was Adam.
Hence, satisfied that he was a monk of St. Augustine's‚·
he jumps further to 1110 almost certain belief that our
author was Alexander, abbot of that house from 1212
101220. Except that the name begins with A, he
could not well have hit upon a more impossible person.
According to Thorn‚ this Alexander was a foster-brother
(“oonnutricius'') and close friend of king John, one of
the few members of his order who adhered to John
through all his troubles,³ Whereas our author, it is
very plain, was far from having any friendly feeling
for John; and he was in exile during the interdict‚
instead of at home and earnest in John's service.

Of what monastery our author was a member, there ·

is, in fact, no actual information whatever. He was
afterwards, as we shall see, abbot of Eynsham, near
