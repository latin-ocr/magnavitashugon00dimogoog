1200, at the time of his coronation with his new queen,
he found time to visit Hugh on his bed of sickness3
and there iano reason for concluding that the kind
compassion which he then expresscd, and the readiness
to adhere to Hugh’s wishes, were not reat} With his
own shoulders, in company with the magnates ot‘ the
land, he helped to bear Hugh's body into Lincoln
cathedra] for intermeat,2 and such an extraordinary
exhibition ot' reverence must, one would think, have
emanated from John himself. Our author says that
the favour which he showed to the cisterciano on this
occasion, and his promise to build them a noble monas·
tery, were owing to his deep feeling of the virtuosos
the departed monk bishop ;8 and the truth of this is
borne out by the Oistercian Annals of Waverley, which
tell us that in the year 1202 the abbot de Firmitate
was sent into England by his superior of Oiteaux, in
order to take possession of the royal manor ot* Feren-
don‚ in Berkshire, which king John had granted two
years before ot Lincoln for an abbey of their order.⁴
John was not all eiril; and we have had, perhaps, in
tho poges of historians, the bad part of him prominently
and unfairly put before us.

Hoveden says that at the visit to Hugh which I
have just mentioned, John confirmed his will. This
is not quite correct, as John had already done this,
at Freemantle, October 6, on his way to London.⁶
