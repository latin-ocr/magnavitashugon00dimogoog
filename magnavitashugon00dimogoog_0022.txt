from a MS. in· the library 01 the “Gemnieensis” Char·
treuse 10 Austria.

As to when or by whom this abridgment was made,
there is no evidence: possibly it may be the Life 01
St. Hugh mentioned by Bale and others, as having
been written about AD. 1340 by a Oarthusian monle
named Adam.

It is scarcely right to call this an abridgment It
is rather a selection of what the compilet deemed the
more valuable portions 01110 original Life ; he himself
calls it, 10 his prologue, an abbreviation. He adheres'
most strictly to the text 01 his author·; sometimes
giving whole chapters even in full; and where he
abbreviatos, never puttiug in a single word 01 his own,
and scarcely ever altering one, further than was
absolutely necessary to the connexion 01 his selected
passages. His selectione 01100 010 made with good
judgmeut; sometimes however, as we should naturally
expect in a medieval compiler, he retains carelully
what most 01 us perhaps now could well spere,-
wearisome accounts, for instance, 01 presumed visions
or miracles tending to the glorification 01 110 hero;
while, on the other hand, he omits just the historical
and other passages, which, though not pertaining
direetly to St Hugh, have still 10 us an especial
interest.

This abbreviation contains more than half, nearly
two-thirds perhaps, of the original Life. It seems to
me that it must have been compiled from a better
aud earlier MS. even than the Bodleian. 110101-
tunately,-by fault 01 eompilcr, or transcriber, or of
Pezius's edibon-more or less, no doubt, of all—the
text as it appears in Pezius is oiten very conupt¹
Still, it gives much good aid, corroborating often what

¹ 'l'he reprint 10 Migne's Patro- in Penius, with additional blandem
legiris simply areprint 01 the Life sometimes 01 ita own.
