If our author be correct in the words which he puts
into the prior’s mouth, then this prior must have been
Guig011.,and Hugh must have come into England
by 1176 at the very latest.

But he did not come, it would seem, before the

Witham. It has been commonly said that this was
in 1181. Itis Bremton who has supplied this date,²

was in 1181 that the Carthusians first came into
England. If this were so, then it must have been a
year or two later, if not more, before Hugh himself
