and the lay-brethren,-aceording to the separate
arrangement then required in u Carthasian monastery,
-had not as yet been decided upon.

Under Hugh's energetic management good prognem

Ihave not scen it, bnt 1 tm speak-
ing from information of hir. Purher.
lt is os transitionnl character, agree·
ing well with the uate ruarmo,
audis just the small plain church
that we should expect in a Curthu-
sian monastery, where the number
of inmates vere few, and where
grsndeur aud ornament were sternly
repudiated Itis in plan an ohlong,
without aieles, with au apsidal east
eud; andhas astonevault ln this
last point it agrees with the descrip-
tion of llugh's buildings at Witham

That is was one os the churches
of the monastery is certain. Neer
it vus that portion of the monastic
buildings which were retained by
the lay possessor aller the dissolu·
tion, some remnants os which still
exist in surm buildings, &a These,
in all probability, as by far best
fitted to the requirements of the new
occupante, would be the buildings
os the lay-brethreu's house, which
eomprised the guest-house, aud all
buildings for secular uses3 and in
this case, this chureh was the “minor
“ eoclesia’' oi the lay-brethren.

'rue ‘⁴ major ecclesia ’' of the
mouks vas probably a church with
aisles; as the Metrical Life (l. 448),
which is generally very true to facts,
describes bases eud columns, us parts
of the new fabric:

‘⁴ Fabrica consurgit, multo su·
“ duta labore

‘⁸ Artificum, solidasque bases,
'“ stabilesque columnas

‘⁸ Machina sortitur, nullum lap·
‘⁶ sura per aevum.”

There was a village, and no
douhtaehurch, when Hugh cume to
Witham.Assolitudewasanessential
requisite to the early carthusiana,
his first act was to have the inhabi-
tants all removed to other places
(infru, p. 68, l. 14, &c.); end it is
just possible that finding their
purish chureh newly built, aud fit
sor the purposes of the convent, hc
retained it as one of the churches of
his new foundation. This, however,
is very improbable3 and indeed our
author seems clearly to intimate that
Hugh built both the churches, as
well us the other parts os thc two
mansione. See infra, p. ot, 1. 23,
&e.; audp. 82.

The Metrical Life of St. Hugh,
which I have quoted above, und in
two or three other places, was writ-
ten soon alteruis canonization iu
1220, certainly before the year 1235.
It seems derived osten from our
Magna Vite, and certainly from the
report of the papal commissionem,
which it direetly nomem but it has
several particulam, derived from
other now unknown sources, or from
thepersonalknowledgcoftheuuthor.
I printed it about three years since,
from MS. copies iu Bit. 1229. 13
A. iv. of British Museum,and Laud
