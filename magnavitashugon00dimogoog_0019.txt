MS M, roez ΤΗΕ text of this volume rs mainlysu( (.1) Mn.

mnodeim 1l- taken from a MS. in the Bodleian¹¹¹¹ &afflig
m ⁰¹¹⁰“L Library at Oxford3 the prese· -mark of&
which rs Diqcy 165. It rs one oi many valuahlc MSS.
presented to the library 111 1634 hy Sir Kenelm Dighy,
the well-known son of a still more well-known un·
happy father.

This MS. forms an octavo volume: it is written
throughout hythe same hand, of the latter half ol
the thirteenth century; in single columns, oecupying
the whole oi each page. It is well written and very

- legihle; and, compared with many, very free from
scribal blunders Though transcribed within about fifty
years of the time when the author wrote, it can eloim
no very early honours of manuscript pedigree. A
euricus interpolation at the bottom of folio 80 proves
itte be, at the very least, a copy of a copy of the
author's autograph¹ It hae no note that tells us any·
thing of its history, by whom or when it was written,
or to whom it had formerly belonged

Such notes it may once have had, as it wants a
few solies at the beginning. Its first page commences

in the middle of the seventh chapter of Book 1, and
