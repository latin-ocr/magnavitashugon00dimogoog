voman's oppression and rescae as he had heard the
tale related by Hugh, and 1100 quite oblivious as to
their exact date. Moreover, this instance ean add
nothing towards proving our author’s belief in 1185 00
the year 01 Hugh's consecration, because Bartholomew,
bishop 01 Exeter, died not only before the summer of
1186, 00 Pezius's editor truly says, but before 1185 as
well, 011 the 15th 01 December 1181.

As to the awkward fact of Henry II. being in Nor-
mandy, and not in England, in the summer and autumn
01 1185, the editor 0110110, 01 the authority of Trivet
that Henry no doubt crossed over thither from Eng-
land in April 01 this year, and was also there in
November; and that, 11 he was there during 111011001-
time, then the circumstances related 01 him by our
author, in connexion with Hugh's promotion to Lin-
coln, could not have taken place in this year. He 10

directly aster he had 1011 11 in April, and gone back
again into Normandy after Hugh's consecration in
September. He attempta 10 produce no authority 101
this, and there is none to be produced. No doubt
whatever there was no 011011 return 01 Henry into
England in 1185, and recrossing into Normandy.

But perhaps the strongest corroborative circumstance
-01 Hugh's consecration September 21, 1186, aud not
September 21,1185, lies in this fact-that September ·
21 fell on a Sunday in 1186, and on Saturday in 1185.
Pezius’s editor treats this 00 01 objection scarcely worth
naming. It is quite clear, he says, that consecratione
01 bishops might take place cn festivals 01 the apostles,
00 1101100011 Sundays Such, indeed, appears to have
been sometimes the case, but under special 011011111-
01011000 only, and by special indulgence 01 the pope.
The rule vas, that bishops 11010 10 be consecrated 011
Sundays only; and 10111110 100001, Durandus says, that
