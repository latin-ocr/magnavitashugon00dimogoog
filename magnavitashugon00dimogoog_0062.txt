10 this proposui, Hugh is then asked for his assent.
After some silent deliberation ha reminded the council
how, a stranger and 1 simple reclusa, he had· been
raised 10110 episcopal office 3 how his ignorance had
rendered 11 necessary for him 10 study diligently the
customs and privileges, the debts and burdens, 01 110
church committed 10 his charge3 111111111111111-
taining 11000110 had as yet not departed from the
right steps 01 his predecessore. He said he was
well avare that mihtary service was due 10110 king
from the church 01 Lincoln, but only 11 England3
beyond the bounds 01 this land no such service was
due. And he declared be would rather return 10 his
own land and 10 his 0111111111 cell, than here hold
the office 01 bishop and allow the ancient immunities
01 his church tube broken down.1

The archbishop then turned 10 Ηο11011, bishop of
Salisbury, and asked if he were willing 10 provide aid
101 his king. He replied that 10 could 101 see how
it was possible 101 him, without enormous prejudice
10 his chnrch, 10 say or do otherwise than according
10 110 answer 01 110 bishop 01 Lincoln, The arch·
· bishop saw that Hugh's sturdy opposition, and righteous
reason 01 refusal that could 101 10 gainsaid‚ had turned
the tide against him, and that thero was no chance
01 110 demand being agreed 10. Accordingly, after-
abusing him bisses-ly, he dissolved the council‚ and
reported 10 the king 1111 the failure was wholly
owing to Hugh.2

Richard 01 course, was furious 11 having his 11-
tempted exaction thus successfully resisted. He orders
110 possessione 01 his contumacious bishops 10 10 im-
mediately confiscated. This was done in the case 01
110 bishop 01 Salisbury, wh0, after much trouble and
many gross insults, was compelled 10 pay a heavy
fine before he could procura the release 01 his property.
