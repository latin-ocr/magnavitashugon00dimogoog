16 transmit worthily 16 posterity, would have been
at the best simply related, 66 116 had been told it
by 666 61 the two actore in it, with no shadow
61 doubt 6661 upon it, with no intimation that 116
had not received full 6661116666 61 116 truth from 1116
lips of Hugh 6166. Had he done this, and had we
somehow known 1116 authority, we might bave laughed
at his eredulity‚ but there would have been no reason
16 doubt his truthfulness3 he would only have told
what he believed to be true. As it 16, be has given
66 6 proof of his rigid accuracy and 116111111111666,

And it 16661 only 66 6 biography 61 Hugh that this
Magna Vite is voluable. As we shall 666, 11 often
gives additional information, 61 throws new light
