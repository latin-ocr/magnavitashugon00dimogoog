From this Parisian MS. is taken the whole of the
first six chaptersof Book Ι. of the following Life, and
part of the seventh, the portion wanting in the
Bodleian MS. The tables of chapters also of the second
and third books are from this MS. only. These are
not in the Bodleian MS, though to the fourth and
fifth books it bas such tables. So far also es this
Paris MS further goes, its text will be found collated
with that of the Bodleian MS. Tbough, almost aa a
matter of course, of far inferior value on the whole to
the much earlier Bodleian MS„ yet it often gives
certainly better readings, and very often readings
which are perhaps better, but which, in deference to
the earlier MS„ Ι have recorded only in the notes.
Ihave given almost all its variatione, but have not
thought it necessary always to record them when they
seemed to me indubitably mere blunders of the scribe.

In editing the following pagos, Ι have had important
aid from printed sources as well. This Life of St Hugh
became well known and highly valued. Several abridg·

ments of it, in course of time, came into circulation.

“ Some of these, of which Ι have seen mention, if now

existiug at all, exist only in MS. ; but others, and per-
haps themora valuable ones, are in print.
