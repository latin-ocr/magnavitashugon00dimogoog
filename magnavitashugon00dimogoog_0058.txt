of the general historian. Indeed it isto the stores
of particular or private history, and more especially

perhaps to the biographies of saints, that we must now

information remains to be gleaned. The more valuable

peges z if not mere servile transcripta, they will be but
compilations, poor and inaccurate often, actually worth-
less sometimes, from the earlier historiens whom we
have long possessed in their integrity. At all events
