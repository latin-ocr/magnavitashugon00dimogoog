Oxford, but this is no proos 11101 he hed been e monk
of this house. His predecessor, obbot Robert, was prior
01 Dore, in Herefordshire, at the time 01 his elcction,¹
ond his successor was prior of Freiston.² At 1110111110,
however, when our suth0r entered Hugh's household‚
Hugh had just succeeded, after long litigetion with
Richnrd I., in establishing his claim 10 the potronege

priest;⁰ 01, us elsewhere, his rnonk and chcplsin ;7 the
