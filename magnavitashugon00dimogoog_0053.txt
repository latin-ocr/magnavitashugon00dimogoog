And of the doings of Hugh as bishop of Lineoln,
before he beeeme a member of his household‚ our euthor

have been, for three full years, in daily communica-

in Hugh’e household ss members of the ohurch of
Liucoln, or ss having had otherwise former intercourse
with him, were well acquainted with the previous
events of his episcopal career.

fit occasions, to recount all the events of his earlier
life, sud delighted to tell of the many eminent men
with whom he had been in contest, or of whom he hod
heard authentis account. Humble‚ moreover, and truth-
ful exmedingly as he wes, he seems to heve had no
reservatione If his own example might be of uso to
hie hearers, he would not only relate his own words
